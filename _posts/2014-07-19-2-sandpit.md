Time flies. It's been almost 8 months since I joined the Sandpit Lab.

### First days:
It was the beginning of January when I walked in to The Sandpit HQ on Adam Street.
At the time I didn't know anyone, except for two guys I met during the 'Hackin the City' hackathon.
It didn't take long until I got to know everyone. Turns out they were all very nice ;)

### What do we do?
This is how I see it. *The Sandpit* is a business incubator/accelerator which is dedicated to finding,
developing and launching the best technologies, products and applications within the sales
and marketing arena.  
For a more detailed description see the [Sandpit's website](http://thesandpit.com).

**[Sandpit Lab](http://sandpilab.com)** is one of the businesses within *The Sandpit*
(I know it sounds complicated). We, as the Lab, use new technologies to help some of
the world's best marketers identify and act on emerging opportunities.
We put huge effort into the products we make to enable new *marketing*.

### Offices
So, when I joined, our office was on 1 Adam Street, it was cool. I liked it because
it was taking me around 30 mins to get there. We worked together with people from
*The Sandpit* and other businesses: [PowerMeeter](http://www.powermeeter.com),
[SoDash](http://sodash.com), [SoPost](http://www.sopost.com) and [DeepCrawl](http://deepcrawl.co.uk).

As we all started growing, the office by Adam Street could no longer handle all of us.
So, the Lab moved to *London's Silicon Valley* - Shoreditch. Now, we are based
in a huge office on the ground floor with loads of day light access; right in the middle
of the hipsterland.

### University and work
I don't know if I mentioned it, but I am still at the University (my university
story is much longer, so I might make a separate post about it). I study at the
University of Greenwich - pursuing a Software Engineering degree.

I started in the Sandpit Lab as a "part-time" contractor. To be honest, I don't remember
working less than 40 hours a week, except, maybe during exam periods.  
I loved to spend time in the office and learn new things (in short, more fun than uni).
That's the answer I give to people who ask me "how is it possible to work and study full-time?"
I always simply answer "it's not possible, you just choose one thing", that's
at least what I did.

### What is it like to work in the Lab?
It's great! I have a chance to "touch" all of the products we are working on.  
Since January I used PHP, Python, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, MySQL,
and many other technologies.
Looking at my personal development I think it's growing exponentially.
That said I feel very happy where I am at the moment.

I also have a chance to work with very cool and experienced people, which only
pushes me to work harder and be better.

### Conclusion
I think this is the longest amount of text I wrote since my Polish lessons back in high school,  
I am proud of myself lol.  

I will keep on posting more about life in the Lab and our open source software ;)
